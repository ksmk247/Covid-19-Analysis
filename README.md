# COVID-19 Data Analysis for India

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook with an analysis of COVID-19 data for India. The analysis focuses on identifying and visualizing trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, comparing state-wise data, analyzing active cases, and exploring correlations between different features.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes a publicly available dataset containing COVID-19 data for India. The dataset provides information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across various states and union territories over time.

## Analysis Performed

The notebook includes the following analysis and visualizations:

*   **Daily New Cases:** Visualization of the daily new confirmed cases across India to show the progression of the pandemic.
*   **Daily New Deaths:** Visualization of the daily new deaths across India.
*   **Daily New Recoveries:** Visualization of the daily new recoveries across India.
*   **State-wise Comparisons:** Comparison of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for selected states (e.g., Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) to highlight regional differences in trends.
*   **Active Cases:** Calculation and visualization of the number of active cases over time (Confirmed - Cured - Deaths) to understand the burden on the healthcare system.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Analysis of the correlation between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries using a heatmap to identify relationships between these metrics.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   numpy: For numerical operations.
*   matplotlib.pyplot: For creating static visualizations.
*   seaborn: For creating statistical visualizations.

## How to Use the Notebook

1.  Open the Google Colab notebook in this repository.
2.  Ensure you have access to the dataset used in the notebook (or update the code to use your own dataset).
3.  Run the code cells sequentially to perform the analysis and generate the visualizations.

## Next Steps

*   Explore other features in the dataset, such as the distribution of cases by age or gender (if available).
*   Implement time series forecasting or statistical modeling to predict future trends or identify factors influencing the spread of the virus.
*   Create interactive visualizations to allow users to explore the data and insights in more detail.
